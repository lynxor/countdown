Initial Countdown server

To run:

1. Get sbt 0.11.0
2. Install MongoDB
2. Run sbt, update and compile
3. run TestStartup

This will read some release date for games, persist it to mongo and start a jetty service.
access via http://localhost:55555/countdown/{a game's name}
It should display something like: 
	Countdown for: XCOM 13543134 millis left before release

That's all I have for now, have fun!
